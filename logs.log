Your task is to create the high-level structure of a truly comprehensive course based on user queries. Consider their experience level, operating system preferences, and what would make a COMPLETE learning path for their goals.\n\n## Course Structure Requirements\nGenerate a course outline that is EXTREMELY thorough and comprehensive. This will be the foundation for detailed content generation, so focus on covering ALL necessary topics for a complete learning path.\n\n## Key Principles\n1. **True Comprehensiveness**: Include ALL prerequisites, fundamentals, and supporting topics - don't assume prior knowledge unless explicitly stated by the user. For web development, this means including HTML, CSS, and JS basics before frameworks.\n2. **Appropriate Scope**: For example: topic like \"MERN stack\", include modules on basic web concepts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, before introducing MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.\n3. **Progressive Learning**: Plan a complete journey from absolute basics to advanced concepts.\n4. **Realistic Pacing**: Set appropriate time estimates for a thorough learning experience (50-80 hours for comprehensive courses).\n\n## Course Elements\n### 1. Course Details\n- **Title**: Clear, concise title describing the course content\n- **Description**: Comprehensive overview of what the course covers (minimum 150 words)\n- **Icon**: Array of appropriate nerd font icons keywords example (for mern stack,  for react, react, reactjs, framework etc ,  for expressjs :backend, express etc. , nodejs etc).\n- **Technologies**: List of ALL technologies/frameworks/languages used, including prerequisites\n- **Difficulty Level**: \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", \"advanced\", or \"expert\"\n- **Prerequisites**: MINIMAL required knowledge or skills before taking this course\n- **Estimated Completion Time**: Total hours to complete the entire course (be realistic - thorough courses typically require 50-80 hours)\n- **Learning Objectives**: At least 8-10 specific skills learners will acquire\n- **Internal Description**: Semantic description that precisely conveys the course content for discovery\n- **Keywords**: At least 10-15 relevant search terms\n\n### 2. Module Planning\nPlan 10-15 substantial modules that create a COMPLETE learning path. The first modules should cover fundamentals/prerequisites, while later modules cover the core requested topics. Just provide the title and a 1-sentence description for each module - don't include full details.\nFirst module should include stuff like (basic command line knowledge (if user does not know that), language step (installing nodejs, or installing go compiler etc) )\n\nRemember:\n- Always include prerequisite/foundational modules (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS basics for web dev courses)\n- Break large topics into multiple focused modules\n- Include both theory and practical application modules\n- End with real-world integration and advanced topics\n- Font query should be generic to the required icon. ex. go insted of golang or gopher\n\n## User Adaptation\nCarefully consider these aspects when designing the course:\n\n1. **Experience Level**: \n   - Unless specified as advanced, assume users need ALL fundamentals and prerequisites included\n   - For beginners: Include more foundational modules and detailed prerequisites\n   - Always err on the side of more comprehensive coverage\n\n2. **Operating System**:\n   - Design a course path that works across different operating systems\n\n3. **Tech Stack Familiarity**:\n   - Unless explicitly stated, assume minimal prior knowledge\n   - ALWAYS include prerequisite technologies and concepts before advanced topics\n    ","response_metadata":{}},"lc":1,"type":"constructor"},{"id":["langchain_core","messages","HumanMessage"],"kwargs":{"additional_kwargs":{},"content":"I want to learn golang from start to finish","response_metadata":{}},"lc":1,"type":"constructor"}],"opts":{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","provider":"openai"},"structure":{"_cached":null,"_def":{"catchall":{"_def":{"typeName":"ZodNever"},"~standard":{"vendor":"zod","version":1}},"typeName":"ZodObject","unknownKeys":"strip"},"~standard":{"vendor":"zod","version":1}}},"timestamp":"2025-04-22 16:10:16"}

This will be the foundation for detailed content generation, so focus on covering ALL necessary topics for a complete learning path.\n\n## Key Principles\n1. **True Comprehensiveness**: Include ALL prerequisites, fundamentals, and supporting topics - don't assume prior knowledge unless explicitly stated by the user. For web development, this means including HTML, CSS, and JS basics before frameworks.\n2. **Appropriate Scope**: For example: topic like \"MERN stack\", include modules on basic web concepts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, before introducing MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.\n3. **Progressive Learning**: Plan a complete journey from absolute basics to advanced concepts.\n4. **Realistic Pacing**: Set appropriate time estimates for a thorough learning experience (50-80 hours for comprehensive courses).\n\n## Course Elements\n### 1. Course Details\n- **Title**: Clear, concise title describing the course content\n- **Description**: Comprehensive overview of what the course covers (minimum 150 words)\n- **Icon**: Array of appropriate nerd font icons keywords example (for mern stack,  for react, react, reactjs, framework etc ,  for expressjs :backend, express etc. , nodejs etc).\n- **Technologies**: List of ALL technologies/frameworks/languages used, including prerequisites\n- **Difficulty Level**: \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", \"advanced\", or \"expert\"\n- **Prerequisites**: MINIMAL required knowledge or skills before taking this course\n- **Estimated Completion Time**: Total hours to complete the entire course (be realistic - thorough courses typically require 50-80 hours)\n- **Learning Objectives**: At least 8-10 specific skills learners will acquire\n- **Internal Description**: Semantic description that precisely conveys the course content for discovery\n- **Keywords**: At least 10-15 relevant search terms\n\n### 2.

Along with the automated deployment and scaling of containers, it provides healing by automatically restarting failed containers and rescheduling them when their hosts die. * *Kubernetes* is an open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing (also called a container orchestration tool). Kubernetes can group ‘n’ number of containers into one logical unit for managing and deploying them easily. It follows the master-slave model, which uses a master to manage Docker containers across multiple Kubernetes nodes.","raw_content":null,"score":0.8763069,"title":"Introduction to Kubernetes (K8S) -
